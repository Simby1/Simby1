# Simby1

Hi there, I'm Simbiat Jinadu 👋
Full-Stack Developer | ALX Software Engineering

## About Me

I've always been driven by the desire to understand how things work—whether it's the complex systems of the human body or the intricate logic of a web application. Now, as an aspiring software engineer, I get to be the reason new things come to life.

My journey in software began with the realization that I could take my curiosity and passion for problem-solving and use it to build something tangible. As a student in the ALX Software Engineering program, I am focused on applying my hands-on learning approach to innovate across industries, from gaming to health tech and beyond.

I'm a believer in building to learn and am always seeking exciting and challenging projects.
